# InfiniteGrid - Conway's Game of Life

InfiniteGrid is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life with an infinite 2D grid using Python and Tkinter. The application allows you to zoom, pan, and interact with the grid through an intuitive interface. Customize the grid by clicking and dragging cells to create patterns and watch the simulation evolve.

## Features

- **Infinite 2D Grid**: Navigate an infinite grid with zoom and pan functionality.
- **Interactive Simulation**: Start, stop, and reset the simulation with keyboard shortcuts.
- **Intuitive Controls**: Click and drag to toggle cells between alive and dead states.
- **Settings Menu**: Access controls and quit the application through an in-app menu.

## Controls

- **Space**: Start/Stop the simulation
- **F11**: Toggle fullscreen mode
- **Escape**: Open the settings menu
- **R**: Reset the simulation
- **Left Click**: Toggle cell state to alive
- **Right Click**: Toggle cell state to dead
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out
- **Mouse Wheel Click**: Pan the grid
